Welcome to my new GitHub Pages site! 🎉

I set this up with Jekyll and the Minima theme. Goals for the site:

- Share development notes & concise guides
- Document side projects and what I learn building them
- Experiment with layouts, automation, and content workflows

Coming soon:

- Improved styling & dark mode
- Resource lists (books, tools, references)
- More posts (first up: workflow & tooling)

If you’d like to follow along, you can star the repo or check back occasionally. Feedback is welcome — reach out at `bariscembakay@gmail.com`.

Thanks for reading — see you in the next post!
